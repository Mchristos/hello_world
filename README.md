# How to package your python code
At some point, you may want to make your python module(s) available as a package. Suppose you have a module called `hello_world` which has a function called `hello_world()`, which just writes "Hello world!" to the console. Lets make it available as a pip package called `helloworld`. 

First, put your source code in a folder with the name of the package (`helloworld`). In the same directory, write a `setup.py` file with the following structure: 

    from setuptools import setup
    setup(name='helloworld',
        version='0.1',
        description='A trivial hello world package for learning how to make a pip-installable python package',
        url='http://github.com/Mchristos/hello_world',
        author='mChristos',
        license='MIT',
        packages=['helloworld'],
        zip_safe=False)
        
Now you can use the following pip command to install your package. 

    pip install .
